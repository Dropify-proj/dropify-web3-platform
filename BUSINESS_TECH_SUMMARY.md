## **üéØ THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE**

### **Web3 Onboarding is Broken**
- **Traditional Process**: Download wallet app ‚Üí Create account ‚Üí Save 12-word seed phrase ‚Üí Buy crypto ‚Üí Pay gas fees ‚Üí Finally use blockchain
- **Result**: 15-20 minute process with 98% abandonment rate
- **Barrier**: Technical complexity that excludes 5+ billion internet users

### **Real-World Impact**
