=====================================

STATUS: ✅ CLI INSTALLED - AUTHENTICATION IN PROGRESS

📋 STEP-BY-STEP CLI DEPLOYMENT:

STEP 1: ✅ COMPLETE (CLI Installed)
----------------------------------
Netlify CLI has been installed successfully.

STEP 2: 🔑 AUTHENTICATE (In Progress)
------------------------------------
The `netlify login` command should have opened your browser.
If not, manually open: https://app.netlify.com/authorize

👆 COMPLETE THE BROWSER AUTHENTICATION:
1. Click "Authorize" in the browser
2. Return to this terminal
3. You should see "You are now logged into your Netlify account!"

STEP 3: 🚀 DEPLOY (Ready to Execute)
-----------------------------------
Once authenticated, run this command:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```

This will:
✅ Upload your 'out' directory
✅ Deploy to production
✅ Provide your live URL

STEP 4: 🌐 ALTERNATIVE DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS
-----------------------------------------
If the above doesn't work, try:

```bash
# Preview deployment first
netlify deploy --dir=out

# Then promote to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out

# Or initialize a new site
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```
