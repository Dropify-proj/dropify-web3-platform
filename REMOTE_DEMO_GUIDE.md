"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I'm [Your Name] from Dropify Technologies.

Today I'm going to show you technology that will fundamentally change how 
people access blockchain - specifically Supra's network.

The problem: 5 billion people use email daily. Only 50 million use crypto. 
Why? Because blockchain onboarding is broken.

The solution: [DEMONSTRATE LIVE]
- User enters email address
- Instant wallet creation
- Immediate token access
- All on Supra's high-performance network

This isn't a concept - this is working technology, right now, on Supra testnet.
